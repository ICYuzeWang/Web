As the prevalence of obesity surges, an increasing number of individuals are resorting to bariatric surgery to safeguard their health. While 3-D reconstruction and virtual reality emerge as potent tools for bolstering psychological support to these patients, thereby enhancing their body image satisfaction and the overall effectiveness of interventions, challenges persist. The prolonged nature of the reconstruction process, intricate procedures, limited accuracy in the reconstructions, and a lack of variability in the presentation of the reconstructed results have impeded the widespread adoption of this promising approach.

This research endeavours to enhance the precision of 3-D reconstructions, streamline the duration of the reconstruction process, simplify the intricacies involved in the reconstruction procedure, and diversify the modes of presenting reconstructed outcomes.

An armature iterative algorithm was introduced to precisely modulate the dimensions of distinct body regions to attain a targeted percentage of total weight reduction. Concurrently, a skin fold simulation algorithm was developed, harnessing the principles of a mass-spring model to emulate post-weight loss skin sagging. The study also engaged in a quantitative assessment of the 3D scanning techniqueâ€™s accuracy and instituted various VR perspectives.

Visualization was achieved for varying percentages of weight loss paired with distinct levels of skin folds. Enhanced 3D scanning techniques were identified through a quantitative analysis. A hybrid approach combining both first-person and third-person viewpoints was employed to optimize the VR experience for participants.

By integrating the two algorithms within the 3D reconstruction phase, the overall procedure time was significantly reduced to 15% of conventional methods. This streamlined approach not only simplifies the process for researchers but also enhances the accuracy of reconstruction outcomes. Consequently, a more comprehensive representation of post-weight loss morphological changes is now attainable.
